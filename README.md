# Staff_Promotion_Prediction_Algorithm-Data_Science_Nigeria_Kaggle_Competition
My winning solution to DSN's qualifying competition; Staff Promotion Prediction Algorithm.
This repository contains my winning code (Main), a playground where I did carry out experiments, and sample submission file.
The competition data can be found here on the kaggle page. https://www.kaggle.com/c/intercampusai2019/data

NOTE: My winning solution is not necessarily the best solution for this challenge. 
But with an accuracy score above 94%, it did enough to get me qualified for the DSN's AI Bootcamp.
